# Extend the functionality of [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)]

Extensions in [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] provide an easy way to add more functionality to the base [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] installation. 

Extensions are provided by the Azure Data Studio team (Microsoft), as well as the third-party community (you!). For more information about creating extensions, see [Extension authoring](extension-authoring.md).


## Add Azure Data Studio extensions

1. To open the extensions manager and access the available extensions, select the extensions icon, or select **Extensions** in the **View** menu.\
    You can also quickly access the extensions manager by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Command+Shift+X` (Mac).\

3. Select the extension you want and **Install** it.

4. Once installed, **Reload** to enable the extension in Azure Data Studio (only required when installing an extension for the first time).


## Access Installed Azure Data Studio Extensions

Each extension enhances your experience in Azure Data Studio in a different way. As a result, the entry point for extensions can vary. Refer to your installed extension's individual documentation for information on how its features can be accessed once it's installed.
